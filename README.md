# Back-end for Lavender mobile app
Group project creating a mobile wellness application, where users are served articles and activities based on their selected mood. Users can also write journal entries which are stored in a Journal Page for users to reflect on. The backend was built in JavaScript using Express and Jest for testing. We connected our seed function to a Cloud Firestore database.
