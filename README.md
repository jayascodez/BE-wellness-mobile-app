# Wellness-mobile-app
Group project in a team of five creating a mobile wellness application, where users are served articles and activities based on their selected mood. Users can also write journal entries which are stored in a Journal Page for users to reflect on. The backend was built in JavaScript using express and Jest for testing. We connected our seed function to a Cloud Firestore database.
